    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>My recipe is my households favorite for anytime simply because, well, its always rib time.This recipe will teach you how to appropriately smoke, baste, and complete your ribs to perfection.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>  
    <ul>
        <li>1 rack of ribs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of Sweet Baby Rays Barbeque sauce</li>
        <li>3 tbspn of butter, salted or unsalted.</li>
        <li>1 smoker of choice</li>
        <li>1 roll of aluminum foil</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the smoker to 200-225 degrees F or 93-107 degrees C. This can take some time and will also give us time to prep the ribs.</li>
    <li>Prep the ribs. Rip the membrane of the back of the ribs. At this time you can add a rub of your choice or simply let the smoke season for you.</li>
    <li>Get smokin'. Smoke the ribs for 3 hours.I usually use hickory, feel free to experiment around to your taste.</li>
    <li>Remove your ribs from the smoker and wrap in foil. Inside the foil add 2 tablespoons of butter and smoke for another 2 hours. </li>
    <li>Get saucy. Baste the ribs in Sweet Baby Rays Barbeque sauce, both sides, and return to the grill for an hour to get the sauce set</li>
    <li>Enjoy! Remove the ribs from the smoker and let them cool down, they'll be hot. 10-15 minutes should suffice. Enjoy your creation.</li>
  </ol>
