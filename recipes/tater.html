    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This is a childhood comfort food of mine. It has all a growin' boy, or gal' needs. Packed with savory ground beef, cream of mushroom, topped with crisp tater tots to bring it all together.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1lb of ground beef, more fat equals a juicier casserole, while lean will be a healthier route</li>
        <li>2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese, this can be supplemented with any cheese but cheddar works great</li>
        <li>1 medium onion chopped</li>
        <li>1 can of condensed cream of mushroom soup, if you enjoy a saltier taste you can supplement creamed beef</li>
        <li>1 tbspn cup of ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>3 cups of frozen tatertots, chances are you're gonna have leftovers, you can get creative for sides!</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Preheat oven to 425F or 218 C</li>
        <li>In a large pan, brown the beef and onions over medium-high heat, break down the meat as it cooks and drain off excess juices from pan</li>
